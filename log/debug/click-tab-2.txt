cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on "Tab #2" located at the top of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or content displayed on the screen to whatever is associated with "Tab #2."

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "in.".

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "adipiscing".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on "Tab #2" located at the top of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or content displayed on the screen to whatever is associated with "Tab #2."
2nd action: The user clicked on "Tab #1" located at the top left of the screen, likely to switch to or view the content associated with that tab.
3rd action: The user clicked on "Tab #3" located at the top right of the screen. This action likely serves the purpose of switching the view or content displayed on the screen to whatever is associated with "Tab #3."

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

Your index=5 action: click id=8


You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "adipiscing".

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "purus".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on "Tab #2" located at the top of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or display content associated with "Tab #2" in a tabbed interface.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on "Tab #2" at the top of the screen. This action likely serves the purpose of switching the view or content displayed on the screen to whatever is associated with "Tab #2."

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "tellus".

However, your actions led you to a loop that did not progress the task. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.
Your suggestion:

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:
<screen>
<a id=6 class="ui-tabs-anchor" pos="top left">Tab #1</a>
<a id=8 class="ui-tabs-anchor" pos="top">Tab #2</a>

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "sed".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on "Tab #2" at the top of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or content displayed on the screen to whatever is associated with "Tab #2."
2nd action: The user clicked on "Tab #1" located at the top left of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or display content associated with "Tab #1" in a tabbed interface.
3rd action: The user clicked on "Tab #2" located at the top of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or content displayed on the screen to whatever is associated with "Tab #2."

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

However, your last action is invalid. You should avoid doing that again and try a different action. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

2nd action: The user clicked on "Tab #1" located at the top left of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or display content associated with "Tab #1" in a tabbed interface.
3rd action: The user clicked on "Tab #2" located at the top of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or display content associated with this tab, as tabs are typically used to organize and navigate between different sections or pages within an application or website.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=6
next action %s click id=6
action to execute %s click id=6
goal %s Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "A".
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

However, your last action is invalid. You should avoid doing that again and try a different action. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "A".
Your past actions are:
You have not taken any actions yet.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=8
next action %s click id=8
action to execute %s click id=8
goal %s Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "A".
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "A".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on "Tab #2" located at the top of the screen. This action likely serves the purpose of switching the view or content displayed on the screen to whatever is associated with "Tab #2."
2nd action: The user clicked on "Tab #1" located at the top left of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or display content associated with "Tab #1" in a tabbed interface.
3rd action: The user clicked on "Tab #3" located at the top right of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or display content associated with "Tab #3" in a tabbed interface.
4th action: The user clicked on "Tab #2" at the top of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or display content associated with "Tab #2" in a tabbed interface.
5th action: The user clicked on "Tab #1" located at the top left of the screen. This action likely aimed to switch the view or display content associated with "Tab #1" in a tabbed interface.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=8
next action %s click id=8
action to execute %s click id=8
goal %s Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "A".
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "consectetur".

However, your actions led you to a loop that did not progress the task. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "Et".
Your past actions are:
You have not taken any actions yet.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=8
next action %s click id=8
action to execute %s click id=8
goal %s Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "Et".
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-tab-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

Your index=9 action: click id=8  


You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Switch between the tabs to find and click on the link "Et".

However, your actions led you to a loop that did not progress the task. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.
