cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-collapsible-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Expand the sections below, to find and click on the link "dignissim".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on the header labeled "Section #1" to expand or interact with that section, which was initially collapsed. This action is typically used to reveal more information or options related to "Section #1" on the screen.
2nd action: The action taken was clicking on the header labeled "Section #2" to expand or activate it. This action likely reveals additional content or options related to Section #2, as it was previously in a collapsed state.
3rd action: The action taken was clicking on the header labeled "Section #3" to expand or activate it. This action is typically performed to reveal or access the content associated with "Section #3," which was previously collapsed or hidden.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=4  
click id=5

next action %s click id=5
action to execute %s click id=5
goal %s Expand the sections below, to find and click on the link "dignissim".
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-collapsible-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Expand the sections below, to find and click on the link "in.".

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion should be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Expand the sections below, to find and click on the link "a.".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on the header labeled "Section #1" at the top of the screen. This action likely expanded or opened the content associated with "Section #1," as the header was initially in a collapsed state.
2nd action: The user clicked on the header labeled "Section #2" to expand or activate it. This action likely reveals additional content or options related to Section #2, as it was previously collapsed.
3rd action: The user clicked on the header labeled "Section #3" to expand or activate that section, likely to view or interact with its contents.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-collapsible-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Expand the sections below, to find and click on the link "vel,".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on the header labeled "Section #2" to expand or interact with that section, which was initially collapsed. This action likely aimed to reveal more information or options related to "Section #2" on the screen.
2nd action: The user clicked on the header labeled "Section #3" to expand or activate that section, likely to view or interact with its contents.
3rd action: The user clicked on the header labeled "Section #1" at the top of the screen. This action likely aimed to expand or collapse the content associated with "Section #1," as it is part of an accordion interface where headers can be clicked to show or hide their respective sections.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Expand the sections below, to find and click on the link "vel,".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on the header labeled "Section #2" to expand or interact with that section, which was initially collapsed. This action is typically done to view or access the content within that section.
2nd action: The user clicked on the header labeled "Section #3" at the bottom of the screen. This action likely expanded or activated the section, allowing the user to view or interact with its contents, as it is part of an accordion interface where sections can be collapsed or expanded.
3rd action: The user clicked on the header labeled "Section #1" at the top of the screen. This action likely serves the purpose of expanding or collapsing the content associated with "Section #1" in an accordion-style interface, as indicated by the element's class attributes related to an accordion header.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-collapsible-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.
