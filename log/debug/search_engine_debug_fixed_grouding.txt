cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Kasie" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion should be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Myron" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the word "Myron" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Myron" into the search field.
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
4th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link, which is typically used to navigate to the previous set of search results in a paginated list.
5th action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
6th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link, which is typically represented by the "<" symbol. This action is likely intended to navigate to the previous set of search results or a previous page in a paginated list.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Riley" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the name "Riley" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Riley" into the search input field. This action likely initiated a search process for the term "Riley."

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

1st action: The user has typed the word "Donovan" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Donovan" into the search input field. This action likely initiated a search for the term "Donovan."
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
4th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link, which is represented by the "<" symbol at the bottom left of the screen. This action is typically used to navigate to the previous set of search results or a previous page in a paginated list.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion should be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Donovan" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion should be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

Your index=9 action: click id=148

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Donovan" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion should be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

reflect_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You went over a series of screens and executed actions to fulfill a top-level goal.
Your action trajectory is as follows:
<screen>
<input_text id=5 class="search-text" pos="top left"></input_text>
<button id=6 class="search" pos="top right">Search</button>
</screen>
Your index=1 action: enter "Kanesha" to id=5  
Your index=2 action: click id=6
Your index=3 action: click id=20."

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Kanesha" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion should be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.
Your suggestion:

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion should be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.
