cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: navigate-tree. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Navigate through the file tree. Find and click on the folder or file named "Leonie".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on an expandable area located at the top left of the screen. This action is typically intended to expand or collapse a section, likely to reveal or hide additional content or folders within a hierarchical structure.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: navigate-tree. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.
