cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: email-inbox-forward-nl-turk. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Pull up the email from Romy and forward it to Shayne.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: email-inbox-forward-nl-turk. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: email-inbox-forward-nl-turk. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.
