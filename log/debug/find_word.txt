cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: find-word. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:
<screen>

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: find-word. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing.

Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the text "A," into the text input field labeled as an answer input on the computer screen.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing.

Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the word "tellus" into the text input field labeled as an answer input on the computer screen.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Find the 11th word in the paragraph, type that into the textbox and press "Submit".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the word "neque" into the text input field labeled as an answer input on the computer screen.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s enter "maecenas." to id=5  
click id=6
next action %s enter "maecenas." to id=5  
action to execute %s enter "maecenas." to id=5  
next action %s click id=6
action to execute %s click id=6
************** reflect_prompt
reflect_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: find-word. You went over a series of screens and executed actions to fulfill a top-level goal.
Your action trajectory is as follows:
The index=1 screen:
<screen>
<p id=4 pos="center">Et nunc neque a, diam donec maecenas. Mauris quis neque malesuada. Nunc, tempus nisi</p>
<input_text id=5 class="answer-input" pos="center"></input_text>
<button id=6 class="secondary-action" pos="bottom left">Submit</button>
</screen>
Your index=1 action: enter "neque" to id=5

The index=2 screen:
<screen>
<p id=4 pos="center">Et nunc neque a, diam donec maecenas. Mauris quis neque malesuada. Nunc, tempus nisi</p>
<input_text id=5 class="answer-input" value="neque" pos="center"></input_text>
<button id=6 class="secondary-action" pos="bottom left">Submit</button>
</screen>
Your index=2 action: enter "maecenas." to id=5  

The index=3 screen:
<screen>
<p id=4 pos="center">Et nunc neque a, diam donec maecenas. Mauris quis neque malesuada. Nunc, tempus nisi</p>
<input_text id=5 class="answer-input" pos="center"></input_text>
<button id=6 class="secondary-action" pos="bottom left">Submit</button>
</screen>
Your index=3 action: click id=6


You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Find the 11th word in the paragraph, type that into the textbox and press "Submit".

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.
Your suggestion:
reflection %s For action index=2, you should click id=5

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Find the 11th word in the paragraph, type that into the textbox and press "Submit".

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail.
