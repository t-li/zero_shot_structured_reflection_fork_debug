cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-menu-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Click the "Menu" button, and then find and click on the item with the icon.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on the "Menu" button located at the bottom left of the screen to open the menu options.
2nd action: The user clicked on the icon that represents expanding or opening a menu, which is typically indicated by a right-pointing caret or arrow. This action is likely intended to reveal additional options or sub-menu items related to the current context.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-menu-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: click-menu-2. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:
<screen>
<button id=4 class="open-menu" pos="bottom left">Menu</button>

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Click the "Menu" button, and then find and click on the item labeled "Next".
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on the "Menu" button located at the bottom left of the screen to open the menu options.
2nd action: The user clicked on the "Menu" button located at the bottom left of the screen. This action likely opened a menu, providing access to additional options or features within the application.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Click the "Menu" button, and then find and click on the item with the icon.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.
Your suggestion:
