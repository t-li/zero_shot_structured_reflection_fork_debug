cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

Your index=4 action: click id=39


You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Kasie" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

Your index=4 action: click id=39


You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Myron" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:
<screen>
<input_text id=5 class="search-text" value="Riley" pos="top left"></input_text>
<button id=6 class="search" pos="top right">Search</button>
<a id=136 class="search-title" pos="left">Riley</a>

</screen>

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Riley" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the name "Riley" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Riley" into the search input field.
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
4th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link, which is typically represented by the "<" symbol, to navigate to the previous set of search results.
5th action: The user clicked on the ">" button, which is typically used to navigate to the next page of search results.
6th action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
7th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link, which is typically represented by the "<" symbol, to navigate to the previous set of search results.
8th action: The user clicked on the ">" button, which is typically used to navigate to the next page of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=154
next action %s click id=154
action to execute %s click id=154
no change, moving to the next iteration.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Riley" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Donovan" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the word "Donovan" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Donovan" into the search input field.
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
4th action: The user clicked on the "<" button, which is typically used to navigate to the previous page in a paginated list of search results.
5th action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
6th action: The user clicked on the ">" button, which is typically used to navigate to the next page of search results.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Donovan" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=28
next action %s click id=28
action to execute %s click id=28
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Kanesha" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Donovan" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the word "Donovan" into the search bar located at the top of the screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Donovan" into the search input field. This action likely initiated a search process for the term "Donovan."

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=28
next action %s click id=28
action to execute %s click id=28
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Donovan" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

3rd action: The user clicked on the link labeled "2" to navigate to the second page of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=50
next action %s click id=50
action to execute %s click id=50
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Donovan" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

4th action: The user clicked on the "<" button, which is typically used to navigate to the previous page in a paginated list of search results. This action suggests that the user wanted to view the search results from the previous page.
5th action: The user clicked on the ">" button, which is typically used to navigate to the next page of search results.
6th action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
7th action: The user clicked on the link labeled "2" at the bottom of the screen, which is likely intended to navigate to the second page of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=134
next action %s click id=134
action to execute %s click id=134
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Leonie" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Leonie" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Leonie" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.
Your suggestion:
reflection %s For action index=3, you should click id=19

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Joye" and press "Search", then find and click the 8th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the word "Joye" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Joye" into the search input field.
3rd action: The user clicked on the "Next" button to navigate to the next page of search results.
4th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link, which is typically represented by the "<" symbol, to navigate to the previous set of search results.
5th action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
6th action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
7th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link, which is typically represented by the "<" symbol, to navigate to the previous set of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=134
next action %s click id=134
action to execute %s click id=134
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Joye" and press "Search", then find and click the 8th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Joye" and press "Search", then find and click the 8th search result.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Leonie" and press "Search", then find and click the 6th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the name "Leonie" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Leonie" into the search field.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=28
next action %s click id=28
action to execute %s click id=28
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Leonie" and press "Search", then find and click the 6th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:
<screen>
<input_text id=5 class="search-text" value="Truman" pos="top left"></input_text>

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Truman" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the word "Truman" into the search text box on the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Truman" into the search field.
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
4th action: The user clicked on the ">" button, which is typically used to navigate to the next page of search results.
5th action: The user clicked on the page number "2" link at the bottom of the screen, likely to navigate to the second page of search results.
6th action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
7th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link to navigate to the previous set of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Truman" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Truman" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Truman" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

1st action: The user has typed the word "Tora" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Tora" into the search input field. This action likely initiated a search process for the term "Tora."
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Tora" and press "Search", then find and click the 8th search result.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Enola" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the word "Enola" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Enola" into the search field.
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
4th action: The user clicked on the "<" button, which is typically used to navigate to the previous page of search results.
5th action: The user clicked on the "Next" button to navigate to the next page of search results.
6th action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
7th action: The user clicked on the link labeled "2" at the bottom of the screen, which is likely intended to navigate to the second page of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=134
next action %s click id=134
action to execute %s click id=134
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Enola" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Leonie" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the name "Leonie" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Leonie" into the search input field.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=28
next action %s click id=28
action to execute %s click id=28
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Leonie" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Leonie" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Vina" and press "Search", then find and click the 9th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.

1st action: The user has typed the word "Vina" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Vina" into the search input field. This action likely initiates a search process for the term "Vina."

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=28
next action %s click id=28
action to execute %s click id=28
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Vina" and press "Search", then find and click the 9th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Truman" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the word "Truman" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Truman" into the search field.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen.  Please separate them by newline, without adding quotes or extra explanations.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=28
next action %s click id=28
action to execute %s click id=28
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Truman" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Olin" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.

However, your actions did not complete the goal. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion must be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken, without any additional explanation or detail. There are three type of atomic actions you can suggested. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter ... to id=...". However, every time you want to enter something, you should always click the desired input field before typing. Lastly, you can press and hold special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.
Your suggestion:
reflection %s For action index=5, you should click id=52
############################ trial %s 4
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Olin" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes.
