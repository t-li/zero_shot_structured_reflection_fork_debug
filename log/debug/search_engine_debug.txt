cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Kasie" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the name "Kasie" into the search text box located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Kasie" into the search input field. This action likely initiates a search process for the term "Kasie."
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
4th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link, which is typically represented by the "<" symbol, to navigate to the previous set of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen. Please separate them by newline.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s 1. click id=70
next action %s 1. click id=70
action to execute %s 1. click id=70
no change, moving to the next iteration.

Your index=1 action: ```

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Myron" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion should be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken.
Your suggestion:
reflection %s For action index=1, you should enter the text "Myron" into the input_text field with id=5.
############################ trial %s 2
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Myron" and press "Search", then find and click the 4th search result.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

Your index=1 action: enter the text "Riley" into the input_text field with id=5.
Your index=2 action: click id=6
Your index=3 action: click id=28

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Riley" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The screen you see is represented by the following HTML code:

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Donovan" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user clicked on the "Search" button located at the top right of the screen.
2nd action: The user typed the word "Donovan" into the search text box located at the top left of the screen. After entering the text, they clicked the "Search" button, which is positioned at the top right of the screen, to initiate a search.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen. Please separate them by newline.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=28

action to execute %s click id=28
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Donovan" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.

You conducted the above actions for the top-level goal: Use the textbox to enter "Donovan" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.

However, your last action did not cause anything to change on the last screen. You probably used the wrong action type. Now, you need to identify the earliest critical step where you made a mistake, and suggest a correction. Your suggestion should be in this format: "For action index=A, you should B.", where A is the action index, and B is the suggested action you should have taken.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Kanesha" and press "Search", then find and click the 7th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the name "Kanesha" into the search bar located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Kanesha" into the search input field.
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen. Please separate them by newline.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

1st action: The user has typed the name "Leonie" into the search bar located at the top of the screen.
2nd action: The user has typed the name "Leonie" into the search text box on the computer screen.
3rd action: The action taken was clicking the "Search" button on the computer screen. This action is typically performed to initiate a search operation, likely using the text entered in the search input field.
4th action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen. Please separate them by newline.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

5th action: The user clicked on the ">" button, which is typically used to navigate to the next page in a series of paginated search results.

7th action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen. Please separate them by newline.
Your plan:

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Joye" and press "Search", then find and click the 8th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the name "Joye" into the search bar located at the top of the screen.
2nd action: The user entered the text "Joye" into the search input field and then clicked the "Search" button to initiate a search for that term.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen. Please separate them by newline.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=28
next action %s click id=28
action to execute %s click id=28
goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Joye" and press "Search", then find and click the 8th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Ashlea" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the name "Ashlea" into the search bar located at the top left of the computer screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Ashlea" into the search input field.
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
4th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link to navigate to the previous set of search results.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen. Please separate them by newline.
Your plan:
cur_plan %s click id=70

goal %s Use the textbox to enter "Ashlea" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.
cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: search-engine. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

The top-level goal you want to achieve is: Use the textbox to enter "Ashlea" and press "Search", then find and click the 5th search result.
Your past actions are:
1st action: The user has typed the name "Ashlea" into the search bar located at the top of the screen.
2nd action: The user clicked the "Search" button after entering the text "Ashlea" into the search field.
3rd action: The user clicked on the "next page" button to navigate to the subsequent page of search results.
4th action: The user clicked on the ">" button, which is typically used to navigate to the next page of search results.
5th action: The user clicked on the "previous page" link, which is typically represented by the "<" symbol, to navigate to the previous set of search results.
6th action: The user clicked on the ">" button, which is typically used to navigate to the next page of search results. This action suggests that the user is looking to view additional search results beyond what is currently displayed on the screen.

Now, you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen. For actions that are not executable on this screen, you should leave them to future planning. Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the screen. Please separate them by newline.
